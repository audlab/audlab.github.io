I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan School of Information, where I am a part of the Michigan Information Interaction Lab.

My research interests lie primarily in the fields of human-computer interaction, virtual/augmented reality and remote collaboration. Recently, I have been interested in studying the use of VR as a collaborative workspace groupware. I use human-centered design techniques to understand how distributed collaborators perform productive and creative tasks in VR.

During my undergrad, I had the privilege of doing research at the RICELab at the University of Toronto, the Human-Centered Ubiquitous Media Group at LMU Munchen and the User-Centered Design lab at Polytechnique Montreal. 

I another life, I used to race bikes.
